# Linux RCs binaries

This repository will automatically build binaries from Linux RCs (Release Candidates)

# Installation
Decompress release a tar file in your filesystem with `sudo tar -hxvf linuxRC.tar.gz -C / --no-same-owner`
notes:
`-h` follows symlinks
` --no-same-owner` makes root the owner of the extracted files
